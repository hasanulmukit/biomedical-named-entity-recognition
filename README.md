# BioScopeNER: A Domain-Specific Biomedical Named Entity Recognition System

BioScopeNER is a professional-grade, extensible pipeline designed to accurately extract genes, proteins, diseases, and other biomedical entities from research articles and abstracts. By integrating advanced transformer architectures (BioBERT, SciBERT), dynamic caching, instruction tuning, and structured prediction, BioScopeNER achieves state‑of‑the‑art performance on standard benchmarks while remaining lightweight enough for GPU‑limited environments such as Kaggle and Colab.
